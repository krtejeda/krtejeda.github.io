I consider the marble steps/slabs to be an example of good design. The anger around their existence seems to be more about how much they cost rather than their purpose. But what is their purpose exactly? Well, I don't really know, and that's probably why I consider them to be well designed. The marble doesn't force us to use it a certain way, but instead it allows the user to attach their impressions and desires into it so it can mold to their expectations. I've seen them function as a seat, a meal table for a group of friends, a piece of art for someone taking a picture, or a playground for children (and adults). I use the marble in all of those ways as well. 

Even more impressive about the marble is that its useful even when in not direct use. Their aesthetic is a hidden function that makes the walks through library quad feel sophisticated yet inviting. Depending on my state, those feelings could help either motivate or excite me. Dieter Ramsâ€™ says "The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being." Ultimately, by looking pretty/inciting curiousity, the marble invites people to interact with them in the forms I mentioned before. Therefore, I'd say the school at least got its money's worth. Not to mention they don't retain heat, so they will always be cool enough to sit on in the summer!
