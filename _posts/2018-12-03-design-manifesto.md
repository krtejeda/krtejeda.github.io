# [Top bun] Toast on grill for one semester

I'm hungry. Be right back...*Phew* I almost wrote an essay that relied on a ridiculous hotdog metaphor to loosely string together a narrative.

Unfortunately I didn’t take a picture of my meal or else I would have shared it here, but if you’re curious, my hunger was satisfied by finally completing the design process. I was first introduced to the concept of user centered design during Winter Study 2018 when nine other students and I, with the guidance of Design Thinker in Residence, Ric Grefe, traveled to IBM Design to tackle a challenge way out of our league; the library asked us to help them rethink the future of the library. We decided the library was fine, colloquially known as “RIP-ing the brief,” and identified bigger institutional issues we wanted to tackle. Long story short, even though we stopped short of the prototyping phase, I loved the experience, and that’s when I first heard my stomach growl…

I was dying for more. Luckily, later that year I worked with Iris Howley and three other students doing just that! I finally got to experience every aspect of the process, but it went by too fast for me to appreciate it. So, again, the experience was just bite size.

I got another chance when I took Human-Computer Interaction in Fall 2018, and finally, I got a good bite, and it was so good. Here’s the recipe: 

# [Meat] Grind together into a patty
### [1. Ethics] Okay fine...I wont be evil
![](/img/Ethics.jpg)

[Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=16&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwic_raFx4XfAhWDTN8KHZLLD34QFjAPegQIABAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.123rf.com%2Fphoto_37665467_businessman.html&usg=AOvVaw00b5vA55Tv9pRnF_brliKI)

Despite the lighthearted header, this is perhaps my foremost important principal and why it is mentioned first. The difficulty with ethics, especially when working in a group, is that they are largely personal and subjective. As such, it is important for any designer to reflect on their values and abide by that strict ethical code. Mine is brief and simple

> avoid harm

This strict code also serves to protect my work from my own biases that could lead to irrational and inconsistent decisions. My responsibility as a designer with the power to create is to enhance the quality of life for those who use my design, no exceptions. Without a strict ethical code for me to reference, I risk subjecting myself to the creation of an endless list of special cases. Worse is that those special cases are often inconsistent with each other because of the lack of a clear foundation/reason for my decisions. As such, a strict ethical code allows me to convince myself and other group members of my rational behind a potentially critical decision.

I would have liked to have made a stronger statement in my ethical code like “do no harm,” but I accept that not all situations are so black and white. Yet even in these situations, a decision *needs* to be made, so it’s important that the implications of that decision align consistently my ethical code. The [Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu) serves as a good example to my approach to ethics. I quickly decided that avoiding harm meant limiting my human influence and not swerving the car into another group of people. The only human influence I employed was if the lives of the passengers were taken instead because they hopefully understood the risk of using the car. Other people apparently felt that traffic laws were more important. However, the point is that my decisions were consistent with my ethical code, and I can be confident that despite the potential controversy, my decisions are what I’ve always believed to be right, not what I felt were right in that moment. If there was a loved one in the path of the car is another question that I don’t think is currently worth answering, but it’s an example of the consequence of designing for all humans, not just myself.

### [2. Accessibility] So easy a baby...actually *anyone* can use

Part of my ethical code of doing no harm includes making sure a design is available to everyone, and I mean *everyone*. When I design for accessibility, I try to fulfill two components:  usability and availability. 

First, a design is usable and intuitive if and only if it is accessible (don't ask me to do the proof, just trust me). As such, designing with accessibility principles in mind and as a priority leads to functional yet elegant designs. The preliminary design after I've made sure it is accessible can then be further refined to incorporate style and personality, but never at the risk of accessibility. In the design of our watch app, we strictly designed for accessibility using Apple’s [Apple Watch Human Interface guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/overview/themes/) and the [Dos and don'ts of designing for accessibility](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Ffiles%2F133121172%2Fdownload%3Fdownload_frd%3D1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNETPD8zlkhx97yLnOXTp0N6UcqlCA) infographic, and what resulted was a beautiful and intuitive design.

Next, a design should not only be available for the intended users, but potential intended users and anyone who happens to find it relevant to their needs. To accomplish this, every design should strive to maximize its potential to reach other users like the curb does with the [“curb cut” effect](https://theblog.adobe.com/design-with-accessibility-in-mind-the-pour-methodology/) (Smyk 1). However, something to be careful about is to avoid generalizing the design to the point where it no longer effectively supports the needs of the intended user. Thus, it’s important to be clear about the intention of the design. For example, screen readers are designed to help the visually impaired with reading on the web, and its availability allows other users to use it as a transcription device, but it is first and foremost a screen reader. I discover the intention of design by exploring its two components: the problem and the purpose.

### [3. The Problem] Wayward compass
![](/img/Problem.gif)

[Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi3ov2yx4XfAhWxUt8KHdY0CC8QjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.memecenter.com%2Ffun%2F632766%2Fwhat-seems-to-be-the-officer-problem&psig=AOvVaw26UdqXX638761JMtkLL2ZD&ust=1543991689159057)

Clearly defining the problem is the first step to beginning any design challenge. To clearly define the problem involves empathy, and that empathy is built through real experience with the issue. For the design process of [Personal CuraTour](https://krtejeda.github.io/PersonalCuraTour/), my group visited and experienced the museum of interest, observed museum visitors using the Fly on the Wall method, and then directly interacted with visitors using a Contextual Inquiry (Hanington and Bella 47-89). Despite that none of my group members or I were previously invested in the state of museum experiences, our continual empathy towards the problem we discovered gave us a clear direction to address them. 

However, our empathy is limited, so it’s important to keep the users in conversation through out the development of the design or create Personas that have the same hopes and fears as the user because as countlessly stated (Hanington and Bella 132):

> The user is not like me

The user is the embodiment of the hopes and fears the problem causes, so whenever possible, Participatory Design should be employed at least partly to make sure the solution incorporates some immediate fixes (Rohrer 1). However, this method should be used to supplement other design methods that don't involve the user because of the sentiment of stagnation implied in this fake Henry Ford quote: 

> If I asked people what they wanted they would have said a faster horse

As such, the user and the problem statement serve as guiding stars and focal points that keep me grounded with the problem, but I only need to converge when I diverge in the search for solutions, and during that divergence it’s important to not lose my purpose.

### [4. The Purpose] *I forgot what I'm supposed to write next...oh yeah!* Don't lose sight of the objective
![](/img/Purpose.jpg)

[Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjUsIPQx4XfAhWCmOAKHSG7BEcQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.expatmakeupaddict.com%2F2015%2F08%2Fwhat-am-i-doing-blogger-identity-crisis.html&psig=AOvVaw0RARuhwybGcVcaPwjtgt2V&ust=1543991750191968)

As a designer, I am responsible for pushing towards my best solution to a given problem. That is our purpose. In order to do so requires a wide divergence into crazy, seemingly unrelated ideas. In the initial stages for the design of Personal CuraTour, some of the modalities we explored were watches, phones, glasses, shoes, and gum… By the time we got to gum, I had to stop us and say:

> Okay. Will this design actually help the user with the problem we identified?

It’s necessary to diverge, but the purpose of the project and the design need to be at the forefront at all times or else the design gets lost. Before spending substantial time discussing with my group about adding extra features, I need think about how it affects the solution and if that solution aligns well with the problem.

In essence, as a human, I am susceptible to fatigue and unfocusing, but if I ever find myself thinking: 

> What am I doing here?

then I need to reference my problem statement to help me redefine my purpose. To reiterate, a problem statement is the clearely defined issue with highlights of the main pain points. The purpose is a subjective, personal decision. It is informed by my values and what I believe to be the best solution to a given problem. 

With the problem statement and purpose for solving the problem clearly defined, I now have a clear intention that will inform the development of my solution.

### [5. The Delivery] Solution™ -- Now available wherever solutions are sold

[Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj108H0x4XfAhVhhOAKHcryCMwQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fknowyourmeme.com%2Fphotos%2F947750-spongebob-s-hype-stand&psig=AOvVaw2yDvWTC78fkarV1mUiSRTF&ust=1543991826704237)

Finally, when a solution and design have been completed, it’s time to tell the potential users about it. It’s almost unethical not to. As a designer, it is my responsibility to promote my design as efficiently, effectively, and honestly as possible towards the previously identified intended users. Deception and false advertising of any kind is unacceptable.

Getting the messaging and presentation right to the best of my ability is key. If the messaging of the design does not align with how the user perceives their issue, then the solution has effectively failed because it’s not going to be used. The name, tagline, and logo should all afford some critical aspect of the design to the user so that they understand the solution the design supports. The high-fidelity of the design presentation helps build initial trust and eventual rapport with the design and the user.

Demos and examples are also necessary to put power into the user’s hands and allow them to gauge the utility of the design for their situation. If there happens to be a misinterpretation of the initial messaging, the user should be offered easily accessible and low commitment examples that allow them the rectify any misperceptions they may have had. Interactive demos built with Invision or other services should be clearly labeled and encouraged for use before the user commits to the full experience.

# [Bottom bun] Serves three people

The user centered design is an incredibly useful tool that emphasizes ethics, accessibility, and utility above all else. There are a number of ambiguous problems facing society that could benefit from the more clearly defined and methodical process of user centered design. However, I concede that the full user centered design process isn’t the end all be all for all problems. Instead, when there is push back from management about how long the process will take or when the entire process would be overkill for a particular problem, I can at least rely on the human principals and problem solving skills that I’ve learned as a result of the process. I expand on a comment I made earlier and restate that my ultimate goal as a designer is to improve the quality of life of *everyone*, somehow, someway. In any project I participate in from here on, there is never not a question about the humanitarian implications of any decision made. The exploitation and unconcern for human welfare is an unacceptable practice. We all have one life. We should get to enjoy it.

Oh no, I'm getting hungry again...

As a matter of fact, I’m starving.
