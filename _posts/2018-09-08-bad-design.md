## "Don't follow the path. Blaze the trail." - *Jordan Belfort* ##

I consider a lot of the walking paths at the school to be bad design because most of the time I don't use them. Many times I've had to resort to cutting across lawns just because I didn't want to take the longer, designated route. The following are some examples that highlight the frustration of poorly placed paths. They show a lack of consideration and forethought for who will use them and where they're going, and thus they don't fulfill their purpose. For example, consider this picture from 2016 of a popular junction:

Do you notice what the issue is? What about in this picture from 2018:

People are actively forging their own, more efficient route to where they want to go. A point that is iterated in "Learning to See" is the idea that function is superior to form and that innovation is subject to expectation. Students don't care that the bird's eye view of the campus is a bit more symmetric because of the path placement. Above all, students want and expect a path that leads them to where they want to be *fast*. The planners of these paths didn't consider the rush students would be in going from Hopkins to Science quad or vice versa. As such, by the paths failing to meet expectations in favor of aesthetics or whatever else, they consequently do little to preserve the grass they're meant to protect.

Another quick example but one that most students are probably use to by now is this:

This is what the ideal and current paths look like:

I just wanted to use this example because it's just annoying. Yes I use the path but not because I like it! There's only so many grass stains I can tolerate. That is all.
