# Problem 
Scaling intimacy. Scale intimacy doesn't mean you have to hire someone to remember your name and make you feel important. In the case of museums it means allowing you to feel like the museum is "yours." Veils are uncovered and anything you want to know about something you get to know. 
Museums always have a story to tell. There is story in the content of the art itself, in the art's conception and creation, and even in how it ended up right there in front of you. Yet, sadly, most of these stories are never told. I admit that "never told" is a bit misleading because technically, in most instances, the story has been shared through the writings on the walls and the curator's arrangement of the art. However, the problem is that these methods are inherently but because it isn't perceptible Other times people don't know what they're looking for. Most people aren't engaging with the art to try and find out the story 
- does reading detract people. inherently academic
