# Motivation

Museums always have a story to tell. There is story in the art's conception, its creation, in the content of the art itself, and even in how it ended up right there in front of you. However, the challenge is that the story is not always perceptible. Most of the time, the story is there, but it’s either hidden, written on some small placard, on a wall somewhere distant, or locked in the mind of a curator who tries to express it through the abstract arrangement of the art pieces. Because the modes of story telling are so scattered, what results is a space that fails to articulate its intended structure. Ultimately, this leaves visitors no choice but to *wander.* To some people, this experience can be boring or frustrating. 

# Problem analysis

I think it’s useful to distinguish between two types of wandering: intentional and unintentional. Intentional wandering is not something I want to resolve because I consider it to be a valuable experience. Wanting to get lost in a museum and engage with art you come across can be enjoyable, so I only hope to enhance this experience. My beef (sorry, I feel that strongly about it) is with unintentional wandering. Symptoms of this include, but are not limited to: superficial glancing of art and arbitrarily picking art to look at. These actions imply people conforming to the “expected behavior” of people at museums, forcing people to engage with the art, or at least pretend to. This isn’t a useful use of their time. We have to accept that sometimes people don’t want to have intellectual experiences, and especially be cognizant that some people might not have had the privilege to learn how to engage with art so deeply. There needs to be a solution that leverages the underutilized stories, and makes them accessible to all visitors.

# Potential solution

In my solution, I want to provide intentional experiences via a guided tour with a “personal curator,” while also supporting intentional wandering experiences. As a guided tour, this system would give visitors the option of multiple themed experiences that span across multiple exhibits. These themes could literally be anything, the goal is just to give the user a feeling of progression and purpose, but some examples could be “Sculptures,” “1900s Art,” and “Contemporary.” As they take the tour, they are joined by a digital personal curator, who speaks to them via headphones. This curator is important for a number of reasons such as: automatically introducing visitors to new exhibits, detailing and elaborating on the pieces that they encounter during the tour or come across accidentally, and providing a sense of intimacy. The last two points are of particular importance. 

First, through some sort of museum camera/gps setup, the system will know which art pieces you’re closest to and start sharing its history, hidden details hidden, and if the visitor sticks around longer, how the piece relates to its surrounding space. I don’t imagine this “personal curator” to be some robotic voice, but instead the recorded voices of the actual museum curators. They have a vested interest in the pieces and would love to share more about them. This part of the system also enhances intentional wandering experiences by giving those visitors even more value when they come across a piece of art unexpectedly.

Finally, the system provides a sense of intimacy by providing the visitor a seamless experience that allows the museum to feel like theirs. Text on the walls next to or somewhere distant away takes visitors away from the art and isn’t very personal. Wall mounted video systems may contain interesting details, but because they restrict movement, there are few who are that interested that they stay committed to the experience. Having the curator explain to you “personally” the art and their intentions is a great way of scaling intimacy. 

All in all, the point of the system is to evolve the inhibitive story telling approaches of current museums into more transparent, and ultimately more informative, experiences.
