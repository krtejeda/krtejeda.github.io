title: (Design Manifesto) Don't do your homework when you're hungry and here's why

# [Intro] Top bun

I'm hungry. Brb...*Phew* I almost wrote an essay that relied on a ridiculous hotdog metaphor to string together a narrative.

Anyways, I find it useful to emphasize that I primarily iden

My personal manifesto/Hippocratic Oath consists of the following principals:

- 
Oh no, I'm getting hungry again...

# [Body] Meat
### [1. Ethics] Okay fine...I wont be evil

[Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=16&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwic_raFx4XfAhWDTN8KHZLLD34QFjAPegQIABAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.123rf.com%2Fphoto_37665467_businessman.html&usg=AOvVaw00b5vA55Tv9pRnF_brliKI)

Despite the lighthearted header, this is perhaps my foremost important principal and why it is mentioned first. The difficulty with ethics, especially when working in a group, is that they are largely personal and subjective. As such, it is important for any designer to reflect on their values and abide by that strict ethical code. Mine is brief and simple

>> avoid harm

This strict code also serves to protect my work from my own biases that could lead to irrational and inconsistent decisions. My responsibility as a designer with the power to create is to enhance the quality of life for those who use my design, no exceptions. Without a strict ethical code for me to reference, I risk subjecting myself to the creation of an endless list of special cases. Worse is that those special cases are often inconsistent with each other because of the lack of a clear foundation/reason for my decisions. As such, a strict ethical code allows me to convince myself and other group members of my rational behind a potentially critical decision.

I would have liked to have made a stronger statement in my ethical code like “do no harm,” but I accept that not all situations are so black and white. Yet even in these situations, a decision *needs* to be made, so it’s important that the implications of that decision align consistently my ethical code. The [Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu) serves as a good example to my approach to ethics (citation). I quickly decided that avoiding harm meant limiting my human influence and not swerving the car into another group of people. The only human influence I employed was if the lives of the passengers were taken instead because they hopefully understood the risk of using the car. Other people apparently felt that traffic laws were more important. However, the point is that my decisions were consistent with my ethical code, and I can be confident that despite the potential controversy, I can be confident that my decisions are what I’ve always believed to be right, not what I felt were right in that moment. If there was a loved one in the path of the car is another question that I don’t think is currently worth answering, but it’s an example of the consequence of designing for all humans, not just myself.

### [2. Accessibility] So easy a bab...actually *anyone* can use

Part of my ethical code of doing no harm includes making sure a design is available to everyone, and I mean *everyone*. When I design for accessibility, I try to fulfill two components:  usability and availability. 

First, a design is usable and intuitive if and only if it is accessible (don't ask me to do the proof, just trust me). As such, designing with accessibility principles in mind leads to functional yet elegant designs. In the design of our watch app, we strictly designed for accessibility using Apple’s [Apple Watch Human Interface guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/overview/themes/) and the [Dos and don'ts of designing for accessibility](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Ffiles%2F133121172%2Fdownload%3Fdownload_frd%3D1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNETPD8zlkhx97yLnOXTp0N6UcqlCA) infographic, and what resulted was a beautiful and intuitive design.

Next, a design should not only be available for the intended users, but potential intended users and anyone who happens to find it relevant to their needs. To accomplish this, every design should strive to maximize its potential to reach other users like the curb does with the [“curb cut” effect](https://theblog.adobe.com/design-with-accessibility-in-mind-the-pour-methodology/) (). However, something to be careful about is to avoid generalizing the design to the point where it no longer effectively supports the needs of the intended user. Thus, it’s important to be clear about the intention of the design. For example, screen readers are designed to help the visually impaired with reading on the web, and its availability allows other users to use it as a transcription device, but it is first and foremost a screen reader. I discover the intention of design by exploring its two components: the problem and the purpose.

### [3. The Problem]

Clearly define the problem
### [4. The Purpose] *I forgot what I'm supposed to write next...oh yeah!* Don't lose sight of the objective

You made something that you feel people will want. Now its time to tell them about it.

# [Conclusion] Bottom bun

Designers and engineers should consider create their own manifesto/Hippocratic Oath. In the meantime By the time I finished this manifesto, I got hungry again. Actually, as a matter of fact, I'm starving.
