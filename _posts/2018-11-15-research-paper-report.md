The paper I read was the study *The Impact of Audiobooks on Reading Comprehension and Enjoyment* by Christopher Wagar. The study pertained with, as the title suggests, the effectiveness of audiobooks on reading comprehension in adults. His motivation for the research was the perception that adult readers stuggle with reading comprehension and have a general dislike for reading. His hypothesis is that audiobooks can be used as a tool to increase reading comprehension and enjoyment of reading. He discovers that this is indeed the case. He tested two groups of readers: a control with no audiobook, and a treated group that read while simultaneously listening to the audiobook. Not only did the audiobook participants perform better on comprehension tests on average, but they enjoyed the experience with the book more than the control group. However, it's important to highlight that this wasn't a study about the effectiveness of listening to audiobooks versus reading, but instead about the utility of audiobooks as a tool to better understand your reading. With that in mind, I do believe that using an audio version alongisde the reading reinforces understanding and retention of the reading, and it is ultimately more effective than excusively using either method.

I read this paper because I was worried about the effectiveness of the audio content in our system. If users ignore, aren't retaining or comprehending the information, then the utility of our design is greatly limited. After reading the paper, I'm a bit worried of our design decision to distance users from reading information about the art. I skimmed some other papers that mentioned how listening and reading comprehension is similar and that there are no noticeable differences between both methods. So if info placards weren't effective for some museum visitors, then the research gives us no reason to believe that only audio information would be any better. This paper makes me wish we incorporated some reading compenent so that the audio actually serves a useful, informative purpose. However, maybe where our design makes up for this reading deficit is the physical context that our design operates in. The audiobook and reading combo is better for books because it reduces the mental energy required for the user to place themselves in the context of the story, while in our design half the context of the audio is accomplished just by looking at the art. Also, users read much faster than audiobooks play, so the story/info progress for audiobook and reading users is often limited by the speed of the audio. In our system, the user is free to listen to the audio, but their museum progress isn't restrained by it. They are free to continue through the narrative of the museum at their own pace and the audio will match their progress.
